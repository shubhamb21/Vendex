Using company data to build levers to improve business performance

As part of a school project we were provided multiple datasets of a vending machine company and were initially tasked
with conducting exploratory data analysis, the ultimate goal being to provide the company with some data driven solutions,
which could potentially increase the profits and performance of the company.

We came up with 4 'levers' to improve performance.

#1
The first among them was a model to predict machine failure which triggers an automated alarm system. This alarm system would
alert an engineer to fix the machine.

#2
In the second lever we attempted to implement cross selling, where we defined association rules between different products in order
to cross sell related items.

#3
The aforementioned association rules were then used to identify products in different categories to replace low or non-performing products
with better performing ones. This was the third lever.

#4
To develop the final lever we used clustering algorithms to group different machines with the aim of replacing low performing machine
types with higher performing types.
